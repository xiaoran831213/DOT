Title: Combining genetic association statistics for a gene-set analysis via Decorrelation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT)
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2020-07-11
Description: Decorrelates a set of summary statistics (i.e., Z-scores or P-values per SNP) via Deccorelation by Orthogonal Transformation (DOT) approach and performs gene-set analyses by combining transformed statistic values; operations are performed with algorithms that rely only on the association summary results and the LD. For more details on DOT and its power, see ''DOT: Gene-set  analysis by  combining decorrelated association statistics'' <https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007819>.
